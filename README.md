Over the last 50 years, the college has graduated nearly 10,000 undergraduates and 3,000 postgraduates,contributing significantly to society.

 He emphasized the importance of never letting opportunities slip away, urging us to seek them out earnestly and make the most of them.Furthermore, he suggested engaging with in-depth content to enhance our understanding and discovering our passions early in our journeys. 
His words resonated with respect and wisdom, guiding us towards a proactive and purposeful approach in our endeavors

#### 4. SSP Rajeshwer Singh
- SSP Rajeshwar Singh inspired us to always choose the path of kindness and helping others. Every good thing we do, and every bad thing too, always matters. He encouraged us to embrace four essential phrases:
1. I am Sorry
2. Please forgive me
3. Thank you
4. I love you

After every mistake and lie, we should immediately seek forgiveness from God. We can deceive others, but we can't deceive ourselves or God. Deep down, we always know the truth behind our lies.Just like Newton's third law states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction, whatever we give to the world and nature will eventually come back to us.
